MythicKeys is a client-side mod for Minecraft Fabric, which allows your client to receive and send keypresses between servers using the MythicKeys plugin.
This mod must be used on a server utilizing the [MythicKeysPlugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mythickeysplugin-add-custom-keybindings.98893/) to add proper functionality.

## Installation:
1. Install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)
2. Install [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)
3. Install [MythicKeys](https://github.com/ASangarin/MythicKeys/releases)

## Usage:
MythicKeys must be used alongside a server running the [MythicKeysPlugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mythickeysplugin-add-custom-keybindings.98893/)
When joining such a server, it will send the configured keybinds to your client and you will be able to see and change keybindings from the game menu.
